// background.js
// Manifest V3 Chrome extension background service worker
// (Stub for future logic; currently required by manifest.json)

// This file is required for the extension to load in dev mode.
// All logic will be added in future phases (Python backend, messaging, etc.)

// Listen for extension installation events (example placeholder)
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  // Placeholder: log install event
  console.log('NLP Resume Optimizer extension installed.');
});

// All additional background logic will be added in future prompts.
